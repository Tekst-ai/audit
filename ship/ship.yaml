          Audit Log
          =========

          This tool will walk you through several steps to
          allow you to customize the installation and deploy Audit Log
          to your kubernetes cluster.

    - config: {}
    - render: {}
    - kustomize:
        base_path: "installer/ship/k8s"
        dest: installer/overlays/ship
    - message:
        contents: |
          Assets are almost ready. Fill out the file at

              ./installer/ship/templates/secrets.yaml

          and then deploy that to your cluster separately.

          Then, you can run

              ./scripts/install.sh

          To deploy the audit log to your cluster.

config:
  v1:
    - title: Basics
      name: basics
      items:
      - name: namespace
        title: Kubernetes Namespace
        help_text: "The Namespace that you'll deploy retraced into"
        type: text
        default: 'retraced'
      - name: hostname
        title: Hostname
        type: text
        help_text: "The hostname that you will use to communicate with the retraced API"
        default: 'http://api.{{repl ConfigOption "namespace"}}.svc.cluster.local'
